  <h1>Refined Berlin</h1>

    <p>
        This is a prerelease of Berlin Refined, expect bugs...
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea of Berlin Refined is to turn OpenData into AccessibleData by providing more acccible ways of accessing, downloading and processing OpenData from the Berlin area.<br /><br />
        Beyond data this site tries to explain some basic concepts of the Berlin OpenData infrastructure and how the primary statistical resources are structured and organized. See for example <a href="{{site.url}}/pages/geographic/lor">LORs</a>
